Character,Line
Cartman,-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
Stan,"Come on, let's go."
Stan,I wanna return this Margaritaville.
Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too."
Stan,"Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy."
Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play."
Kyle,Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Kyle,Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
Cartman,The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
Cartman,"YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!"
Cartman,"Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?"
Stan,I don't like it. It's spooky.
Stan,"Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand."
Kyle,He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
Kyle,"All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it."
Stan,I just opened an account.
Cartman,"I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!"
Stan,We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
Stan,"Dude, what's the matter?"
Cartman,"Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants."
Cartman,...well Token doesn't know that.
Stan,Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
Butters,You think Jewpacabra is here?
Butters,Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
Stan,"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!"
Mr. Garrison,Then who was it?
Randy,"Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace."
Kyle,Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
Kyle,Oh for the love of God!
Kyle,I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
Stan,Let's watch something else.
Cartman,"Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O."
Kyle,"Good for you, Charlie!"
Stan,We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
Kyle,It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
Stan,"Dude, the hell just happen?"
Stan,I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
Stan,"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!"
Butters,They're gonna do it!
Randy,"No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien."
Randy,"Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?!"
Stan,"Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you."
Stan,"I have to do this, okay? I have to!"
Stan,Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
Stan,"Then let's go, dude!"
Cartman,"Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!"
Kyle,"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now."
Stan,"Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?"
Stan,"Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?"
Cartman,Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
Butters,Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
Stan,"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time."
Cartman,"Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us."
Randy,My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
Stan,"Let's just do this, all right?"
Cartman,"You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  ""Shit."""
Mr. Garrison,"""But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."""
Stan,How should we split up?
Cartman,"Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!"
Butters,Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
Kyle,All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
Cartman,"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control."
Cartman,I'll make you eat your parents!
Cartman,"Okay, let's go, Jew!"
Cartman,Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
Cartman,"Just do what you were sent to do, dickface!"
Kyle,Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
Butters,"AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"
Randy,"Well, Stan, it's not really our-"
Stan,"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?"""
Cartman,"Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted."
Stan,Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
Cartman,"Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body."
Stan,"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude."
Kyle,"Knock it off, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work."
Stan,"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!"
Stan,I know! This is awesome!
Mr. Garrison,"Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda."
Butters,Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
Stan,I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
Stan,"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!"
Kyle,"Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student."
Kyle,"Dude, he's pretty dead."
Stan,I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Cartman,"Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer."
Stan,So what should we do?
Kyle,"I'm a Paladin, Cartman!"
Randy,"Well, maybe it's time."
Butters,"Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places."
Cartman,"Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff."
Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive."
Kyle,"I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money."
Cartman,Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
Stan,"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front."
Kyle,"This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma."
Randy,"Hey, back off, cunt!"
Stan,Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
Cartman,"Yeah, I like fishsticks."
Stan,I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
Cartman,"Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls."
Randy,Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
Cartman,"Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously."
Stan,Get over here and untie us!
Stan,"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches."
Butters,"Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck!"
Randy,Oh no! Oho oho.
Kyle,"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering."
Randy,I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick.
Stan,"Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it."
Stan,"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!"
Cartman,"Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!"
Kyle,We made two dollars.
Cartman,"What do you mean, what am I doing?! Im just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys."
Cartman,"You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!"
Cartman,"Haha, charade you are, Scott!"
Stan,Is he doing it again?
Stan,"Stop, you fucking lunatic!"
Randy,You can't just keep us in here!
Cartman,"Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!"
Butters,"Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too."
Mr. Garrison,"Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie."
Randy,"Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!"
Stan,"Dad, Death is coming!"
Kyle,"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!"
Cartman,Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
Stan,"Hoh boy, we're in big trouble."
Stan,"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster."
Cartman,"Alright, alright.  Kyle..."
Kyle,Ugh! Those dirty liars!
Cartman,"I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!"
Stan,"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny."
Cartman,How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
Stan,"But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe."
Butters,"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go."
Stan,That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Butters,But you said they were on their way like three hours ago!
Stan,"Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet."
Stan,"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection."
Stan,"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice."
Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me."
Cartman,"Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling."
Cartman,A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
Stan,Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
Cartman,I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
Cartman,"My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle."
Kyle,"No way!  You do it, Kenny!"
Cartman,...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
Stan,But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Butters,Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
Kyle,"Yes, but he thrives on that."
Cartman,"Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes."
Cartman,"That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?"
Butters,"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?"
Cartman,"Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out."
Stan,It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy.
Kyle,"Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please."
Kyle,"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!"
Kyle,Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
Butters,"Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire."
Cartman,"That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!"
Cartman,"Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice."
Cartman,Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
Kyle,"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?"
Kyle,"No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children."
Stan,So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
Cartman,"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!"
Cartman,Help me! Hellp mee!
Randy,"The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you."
Cartman,No? How about this?
Kyle,Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it!
Kyle,I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
Cartman,"You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!"
Cartman,"""SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!"
Cartman,"The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up."
Cartman,"Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now."
Randy,I know where it is!
Kyle,Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
Butters,"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!"
Stan,"It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell."
Cartman,I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
Stan,"Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses."
Stan,"Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?"
Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well."
Randy,"Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ""ahta"" will start becoming a major part of your life."
Kyle,"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do."
Stan,"Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool."
Cartman,"Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na."
Kyle,Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Kyle,"Go ahead and tell him, Cartman."
Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?"
Stan,"Uh, no! I hate that toy!"
Randy,"Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!"
Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it."
Kyle,"Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there."
Stan,Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Randy,"Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this."
Cartman,"All right, Bebe, let's see the list."
Kyle,"""Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!"
Cartman,I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
Cartman,Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
Kyle,Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Cartman,Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
Kyle,"Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?"
Stan,Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Cartman,"You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel."
Kyle,He's right. It's just a spook story.
Kyle,We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
Kyle,I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
Stan,"You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!"
Cartman,"There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!"
Kyle,"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!"
Kyle,"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!"
Cartman,"Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad."
Butters,That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
Cartman,"Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?"
Cartman,"...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!"
Mr. Garrison,"Ogod, you're not gonna lay that Channukah crap on me, are you?"
Cartman,"Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers."
Stan,Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
Mr. Garrison,"Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?"
Kyle,"I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle."
Cartman,"Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!"
Cartman,"Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?"
Stan,"Yeah, go on dude!"
Kyle,Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
Cartman,I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
Mr. Garrison,"OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding!"
Cartman,I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs.
Cartman,I'm gonna be Jesus!
Cartman,"...naw, that didn't work either."
Cartman,"Ah I don't think so, dude."
Cartman,"You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please."
Cartman,"That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie!"
Butters,Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
Cartman,"Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door."
Kyle,"Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one."
Kyle,Well what are you watching?
Cartman,But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
Kyle,"No dude, that makes you gay!"
Butters,"Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas."
Kyle,"Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease."
Butters,"Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?"
Kyle,"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?"
Cartman,Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
Cartman,Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
Randy,Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths.
Stan,"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?"
Stan,True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Cartman,"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?"
Kyle,I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
Cartman,"You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw!"
Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore."
Butters,"All week long, bossman say"
Stan,"Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!"
Randy,...Are those good moral values?
Randy,"I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche."
Cartman,"Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!"
Kyle,But I have to get off!
Randy,"I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside!"
Randy,It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
Butters,"Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club."
Stan,"Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!"
Cartman,"Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans."
Butters,What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
Cartman,Or if I did?
Cartman,Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
Randy,"I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful."
Stan,I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
Butters,"Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem."
Kyle,"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!"
Cartman,"I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum."
Randy,...I'm not a r-tard.
Kyle,What's he doing at his teacher's house?
Kyle,"Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!"
Kyle,So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
Cartman,"This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people."
Kyle,"No. No, it'll be okay!"
Butters,"Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian."
Randy,"That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!"
Stan,"Hey! Hey, open the door!"
Stan,"So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?"
Stan,"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?"
Cartman,"Oh, you're going down, Elin!"
Cartman,Where are you going?!
Stan,"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!"
Stan,"Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai."
Cartman,"Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!"
Randy,Stan I... need your help.
Stan,Does this mean we don't have school all week?
Cartman,"Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?"
Kyle,He singing some new hit song.
Kyle,What are we supposed to do with him?
Butters,Okay. I'm not lookin'.
Cartman,"Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?"
Kyle,"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!"
Randy,"So who won, Mr. Mackey?"
Kyle,"Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!"
Cartman,"Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!"
Cartman,"Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends."
Cartman,Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
Cartman,"He is real, you guys."
Stan,"Okay, it's all clear."
Butters,"Oh God, oh my God no!"
Stan,Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
Randy,"Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour."
Mr. Garrison,"Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?"
Kyle,"Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load."
Stan,"Hey, look! We blew up the snake!"
Cartman,How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
Kyle,We have a dead friend.
Mr. Garrison,Holy poop on a stick!
Cartman,"'""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""'"
Stan,Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
Stan,"Mr. Mackey, stop running!"
Randy,"It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say ""hey"" guys."
Kyle,Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
Stan,Just leave me alone!
Kyle,"Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters?"
Butters,"Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em."
Cartman,It's a cool island song.
Randy,"Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself."
Butters,"Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum."
Stan,It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
Cartman,"Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard."
Cartman,"Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out."
Randy,"Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet."
Kyle,We don't... really know the difference.
Stan,Hey! So what are you going to do now?
Cartman,Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
Stan,Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
Randy,"We are the same, she and I."
Mr. Garrison,"We're doomed! Good-bye, Mr. Hat."
Butters,"HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!"
Randy,"Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works!"
Cartman,"He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat."""
Cartman,"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!"
Butters,"We aren't makin' that much, fellas."
Randy,"You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition."
Butters,"Oh, not really sir, I just uh..."
Stan,"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?"
Cartman,"So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights."
Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?"
Cartman,Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
Butters,"Okay, I got it!"
Butters,Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
Kyle,"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake."
Butters,"So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?"
Cartman,"Hey, what are you doing?"
Randy,"Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators."
Kyle,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine."
Cartman,"Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir."
Cartman,"No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now."
Mr. Garrison,"...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!"
Cartman,He's not a fag!
Butters,"Uhh,  mahjey burazi?"
Cartman,"Dude, this is hella cool."
Stan,"No you don't, fatass!"
Randy,"Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?"
Stan,"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good."
Kyle,"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?"
Randy,"Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!"
Kyle,But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
Cartman,U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
Butters,"How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?"
Stan,"That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!"
Stan,What am I supposed to do about it?
Stan,You scram! We were here first!
Stan,What's a - homosexual?
Kyle,Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
Cartman,"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!"
Cartman,You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
Kyle,"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great."
Butters,"Awww jeez, you're no fun."
Stan,When do we want it?
Stan,You mean like a baker and a cop?
Stan,"Oh, shit!  Oh!"
Cartman,What the fuck is this?!
Cartman,That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
Stan,I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
Kyle,"Wow, look at all these people playing right now."
Cartman,Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
Kyle,What's the matter dude?
Stan,So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
Kyle,Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
Randy,"Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything."
Stan,"I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times."
Cartman,"Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it!"
Stan,"Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?"
Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy?"
Cartman,"What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?"
Stan,"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels..."
Randy,"Oh, that is beautiful!"
Randy,Who are the Harrisons?
Kyle,"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?"
Stan,"There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped."
Butters,"Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu."
Randy,"Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape."
Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!"
Kyle,"Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had-"
Cartman,Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
Randy,No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
Randy,"Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone!"
Cartman,"Yes, we sure do."
Kyle,Did you do it?
Cartman,...I don't understand the difference.
Stan,I haven't been sleeping well.
Cartman,The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
Kyle,You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
Kyle,"You were, you were right?"
Kyle,Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy...
Kyle,"Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle."
Cartman,"All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!"
Stan,Have I missed anything?
Stan,"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos."
Stan,So why can't he live here now?
Stan,"Does this month, November, hold a special significance?"
Kyle,Yeah. She's really cool.
Randy,"I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started..."
Cartman,"It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!"
Kyle,He's my new pet elephant.
Butters,"Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families."
Cartman,Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
Kyle,"Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies."
Stan,"Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?"
Cartman,"No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part."
Cartman,"She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday..."
Stan,"Just drink the pee, Kyle."
Cartman,"I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima."
Stan,I didn't think so.
Cartman,"But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right?"
Kyle,Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
Stan,"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real."
Cartman,You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
Stan,"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting."
Stan,"Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??"
Cartman,"Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!"
Kyle,You are up there!
Stan,Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
Cartman,"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all."
Butters,"Sing your Song, earn your pay"
Kyle,"Okay, okay, you can have your powers back."
Stan,"Oh uh, hey Nelson."
Cartman,"No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out"
Cartman,"No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye."
Butters,No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!
Cartman,"Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!"
Stan,Pry his mouth open!
Cartman,"He's a little wuss, what's it look like?"
Cartman,"Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him."
Cartman,"Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha-"
Kyle,"Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny."
Kyle,Ready to go Stan?
Kyle,They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
Stan,Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
Kyle,"Uuuh, okay.  Gah!"
Cartman,I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
Kyle,"No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!"
Stan,"Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-"
Kyle,"Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off."
Kyle,"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad."
Kyle,What are you doing?
Stan,"The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?"
Stan,"Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?"
Stan,"Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?"
Kyle,"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss."
Stan,"But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?"
Cartman,Could you please use it in a sentence?
Stan,"Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?"
Stan,"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures."
Randy,"Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that."
Cartman,"Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken."
Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!"
Kyle,I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points.
Stan,"Where have you been, Cartman?"
Cartman,"Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!"
Kyle,"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?"
Stan,"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys."
Randy,"You need to shape up, mister."
Randy,You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
Stan,"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?"
Kyle,This is how I look natural.
Butters,"Oh no, my Dad?"
Butters,How far away is June?
Cartman,"Uhh yes, of course?"
Kyle,"Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!"
Randy,"No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?"
Stan,"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!"
Cartman,"What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible."
Cartman,"What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo."
Stan,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with."
Mr. Garrison,Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Cartman,"Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!"
Stan,"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!"
Butters,"It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom."
Cartman,I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!
Cartman,We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
Cartman,"Yeah, I have some pubes to sell."
Cartman,"My mom made it, isn't it cool?"
Kyle,"Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances."
Cartman,Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
Stan,"Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!"
Stan,Have you confessed all your sins yet?
Kyle,"You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!"
Cartman,"...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person."
Stan,"Well dude, what are we supposed to do?"
Kyle,Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off!
Kyle,"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!"
Kyle,"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!"
Kyle,Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
Cartman,Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
Cartman,"Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro."
Stan,"Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night."
Cartman,"Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?"
Butters,He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes.
Cartman,"It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!"
Butters,I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
Cartman,"Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny."
Cartman,"Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!"
Cartman,"Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?"
Cartman,"C, H. ""Ch."" Chalk."
Kyle,We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
Cartman,"Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you."
Randy,At least we're smart enough to know better!
Kyle,We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
Butters,"Yeah, ahh, that's right!"
Kyle,"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya."
Stan,"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary?"
Stan,"Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?"
Cartman,Oh. We don't know him.
Stan,"Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?"
Cartman,That's more like it.
Cartman,"All right, hit one out of the park!"
Cartman,Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up.
Kyle,There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Stan,"Dude, Butters, calm down."
Cartman,"No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!"
Cartman,Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
Cartman,"O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?"
Stan,"Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple."
Stan,"Damn, dude. Look at all these people."
Cartman,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person."
Stan,"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!"
Kyle,That's a towel call?
Randy,Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup.
Randy,"Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day."
Stan,He hits this switch-
Butters,"Oh boy, I sure am nervous."
Randy,I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
Stan,Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
Stan,We've come to... ask you for help.
Cartman,"Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor."
Stan,"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all."
Kyle,"All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!"
Cartman,"Because, because what? Because he's cute?"
Cartman,"I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles."
Cartman,NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
Kyle,You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
Stan,"We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys."
Cartman,"Here, talk to them, Butters."
Kyle,We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
Stan,"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is."
Stan,"Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!"
Butters,It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
Kyle,"Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it."
Cartman,"Not so fast, Kyle."
Butters,"Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the ""Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."""
Randy,"Will you relax, Stan?"
Cartman,But we don't have to lose.
Butters,"Equipment is flying in, ten seconds."
Kyle,Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here!
Kyle,You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
Stan,It was my mom's credit card.
Randy,I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
Stan,"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?"
Cartman,Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
Cartman,And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
Kyle,"Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!"
Mr. Garrison,A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
Cartman,"No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long."
Kyle,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary."
Stan,We can't let our party suck.
Stan,So this is normal?
Kyle,Aaaaa! There's a dude here!
Kyle,We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
Cartman,"'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!"
Cartman,"And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop."
Stan,"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant."
Kyle,We've gotta keep this away from him.
Randy,"Why, why would we punch trees?"
Randy,I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
Cartman,"That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault."
Kyle,"Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!"
Cartman,"Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!"
Kyle,"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school."
Randy,"Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!"
Stan,D'you know John Elway?
Stan,"Dude, did you do all your homework last night?"
Kyle,"Well, I'm sure it was him."
Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?"
Cartman,What the hell happened to him?
Cartman,You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog.
Kyle,Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
Butters,"This is, General Disarray. My final solution."
Cartman,"There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!"
Cartman,Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
Stan,Well that burned a long time.
Cartman,"They look great on you, Butters. They really do."
Kyle,"Which button did you press, Cartman??"
Kyle,And then you said
Cartman,But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
Cartman,"You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!"
Stan,"Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!"
Cartman,"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out."
Butters,Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
Kyle,Why would he do this?!
Cartman,"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys""  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  ""So what are you into?""  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  ""Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?""  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!"
Butters,"Oh my God, the police are looking for us!"
Mr. Garrison,We can save the town and be super-rich!
Kyle,What's in it for us?
Cartman,"No, you just have to save me."
Stan,"Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?"
Butters,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!"
Cartman,H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!
Cartman,Just give me my money back.
Cartman,What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!!
Stan,"No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped."
Stan,You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
Stan,We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
Cartman,"What, what is it? What is it for?"
Kyle,Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
Kyle,Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
Stan,"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!"
Stan,How can they even call that a movie?
Stan,"Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!"
Stan,Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Kyle,"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!"
Cartman,Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
Randy,Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
Kyle,And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
Stan,"Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!"
Stan,"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse."
Kyle,What a stupid asshole!
Cartman,"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy."
Randy,"Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it."
Cartman,"Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones."
Randy,What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
Cartman,You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
Stan,"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!"
Mr. Garrison,"I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!"
Cartman,"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!"
Stan,"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too."
Butters,"Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead."
Cartman,"This thing is recording, right?"
Cartman,"Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!"
Kyle,"Oh, dude, what a little asshole!"
Mr. Garrison,I am not gay!
Stan,"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore."
Cartman,They look exactly the same.
Kyle,It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
Cartman,"Stinky britches, you got stinky britchesStinky, stinky britches, you got stinky--"
Stan,I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you.
Cartman,"Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia."
Stan,"Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!"
Stan,"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard."
Cartman,"Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!"
Kyle,Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
Stan,"I dunno. Craig, is that you?"
Butters,"Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone."
Kyle,"Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest."
Stan,It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
Cartman,Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
Kyle,I'm actually the complete opposite.
Kyle,But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
Stan,"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!"
Butters,"Mom, Dad!  I changed back!"
Stan,"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?"
Kyle,You need to freeze some of your ass off.
Cartman,"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters?"
Stan,"I can't afford a cruise, dude."
Butters,And our parents hollered at us!
Stan,You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
Kyle,"It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!"
Stan,"This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!"
Kyle,Dad! You tasered my dad!
Kyle,It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
Mr. Garrison,"Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve."
Cartman,"Suck my asshole, taco vendor!"
Cartman,Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
Kyle,We're not going anywhere without Chef.
Randy,"Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie."
Butters,"Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse."
Cartman,"Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch."
Kyle,"Yeah. Good job, fatass!"
Stan,"Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!"
Kyle,"...Uuh, can I talk to her?"
Randy,"All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today."
Cartman,"Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!"
Stan,"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store."
Kyle,"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?"
Kyle,Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Cartman,"God, I hate old people!"
Stan,Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
Cartman,"Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!"
Kyle,"All right!  Dad, I can play!"
Cartman,What the hell are they doing?
Kyle,Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
Cartman,"If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom."
Stan,"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!"
Cartman,I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
Cartman,"Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas."
Stan,He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
Cartman,You just want me to open the door!
Cartman,"Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time."
Cartman,Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
Cartman,"I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!"
Randy,"Who who did you hear is, is gay?!"
Cartman,"You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy!"
Stan,"Gah, let's go you guys."
Stan,...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
Cartman,"It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!"
Kyle,"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over."
Cartman,"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?"
Mr. Garrison,"And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering."
Stan,So I can return it to a bank?
Stan,"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime."
Stan,Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya.
Cartman,"Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in."
Stan,"Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end."
Stan,"Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here."
Stan,"Okay, what have you got?"
Mr. Garrison,"Chef, can I talk to you?"
Kyle,"If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!"
Kyle,Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
Butters,Oh gosh in heaven.
Butters,"Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening."
Cartman,I-I'll try. I'll try.
Cartman,"Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface."
Cartman,They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
Stan,"Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses."
Kyle,Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
Cartman,You're not allowed to have people over!
Cartman,"Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks"
Cartman,What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
Stan,"Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all."
Cartman,"Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow."
Stan,"Now, do you believe this, Cartman?"
Randy,"Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!"
Mr. Garrison,"Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch."
Stan,"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?"
Kyle,"Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back."
Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
Butters,"Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane."
Cartman,"What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?"
Stan,"It's okay, Mom. I understand."
Stan,I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh-
Cartman,"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do."
Butters,"Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!"
Cartman,"Yes, well, we weren't."
Cartman,"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There!"
Stan,"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!"
Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?"
Randy,So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too!
Butters,"Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?"
Cartman,"Trent Boyett is a liar, sir."
Cartman,"I'm first, I'm first!"
Kyle,"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but..."
Randy,"Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me."
Kyle,I can't believe how cold it is out here.
Cartman,"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!"
Kyle,We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
Kyle,"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya."
Stan,"Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll."
Cartman,"Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!"
Kyle,"He said, not now, Craig!"
Randy,"""He took a- and then-"" Oh, man. Oh, this-"
Randy,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks."
Stan,Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
Cartman,They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
Randy,"Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!"
Stan,"Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!"
Stan,"You tell 'em, Cartman!"
Kyle,"The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage""."
Stan,"Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!"
Stan,You woke him up!
Randy,This guy doesn't know when to quit!
Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven."
Randy,"Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved."
Cartman,"Oh my God, this is awesome!"
Kyle,Will you shut up already?!
Mr. Garrison,There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
Cartman,"Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it."
Cartman,Look what we got.
Cartman,That's a very pretty dress.
Mr. Garrison,"Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!"
Cartman,No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh!
Cartman,"Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is!"
Stan,"Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!"
Kyle,"If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?"
Cartman,Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
Kyle,"What is a proc-tologist, Chef?"
Cartman,"Butters, it was my pleasure."
Stan,"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!"
Stan,Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
Stan,"...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower."
Randy,"Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me."
Kyle,"Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band."
Stan,"No, there's no blood coming out of my ass."
Cartman,But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
Stan,The bus is going over!
Butters,Two years ago. Two years ago!
Stan,People are saying that?
Cartman,"Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??"
Kyle,"Hi Mom, Hi Dad!"
Cartman,"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over."
Cartman,I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
Cartman,We had a little problem.
Stan,What does that mean?
Stan,I already lost all my baby teeth.
Kyle,"Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!"
Stan,"Come on, let's do this!"
Stan,"...That makes perfect sense, Butters."
Butters,Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
Randy,"Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit!"
Stan,Tell them not to burn us down.
Cartman,"Well, I do just as much work."
Cartman,How many students is that?
Cartman,Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry.
Stan,But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
Randy,Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!
Kyle,Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
Stan,"Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!"
Kyle,"Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship."
Stan,"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please."
Cartman,"Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own."
Kyle,"Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!"
Butters,It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Kyle,"Damn, CAA is pretty impressive."
Stan,Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
Stan,"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy?"
Stan,Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
Stan,Tell me about it.
Randy,"Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?"
Cartman,Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
Stan,"Dude, I'm not going."
Kyle,Well... if you put it that way...
Cartman,"Ew, doesn't that hurt?"
Cartman,"It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!"
Stan,Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
Cartman,"They mostly come at night, mostly.  Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!"
Kyle,Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
Randy,Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
Cartman,"Hello hello, are you still there?"
Butters,"Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more."
Kyle,"Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous."
Cartman,"Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!"
Cartman,And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
Stan,"You guys, we're gonna lose our client."
Mr. Garrison,"Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure."
Kyle,"All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother."
Randy,Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?!
Butters,"I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato."
Kyle,"Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park."
Cartman,"You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man."
Kyle,Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
Cartman,"Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now."
Stan,Why does that matter?
Cartman,Could you turn up the heat just a little?
Mr. Garrison,"Okay, kids, get ready to take your places."
Cartman,"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek."
Cartman,"Butters, what are you up to?"
Cartman,"I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time."
Stan,"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back."
Randy,Let's hear it for Gerald!
Kyle,"Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!"
Stan,The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
Butters,"Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event."
Kyle,"You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport."
Cartman,"Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike."
Stan,"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?"
Cartman,Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
Cartman,"Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!"
Cartman,"Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!"
Butters,We can't tell you.
Kyle,So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
Cartman,There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
Cartman,"Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit"
Randy,"Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!"
Kyle,"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?"
Kyle,"Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!"
Cartman,No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
Cartman,"I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!"
Kyle,What are they doing?
Kyle,"Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again."
Cartman,God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
Stan,I have no idea.
Cartman,Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
Kyle,It looks like a UFO.
Stan,What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Cartman,"Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!"
Stan,"It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-"
Cartman,"Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!"
Mr. Garrison,And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
Stan,"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!"
Cartman,"Well, hi there.  Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?"
Stan,"Oh, nice going, Cartman!"
Cartman,"Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!"
Stan,"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers."
Stan,"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!"
Kyle,"Chef, the police are asking questions about you!"
Stan,"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!"
Cartman,"Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name?"
Mr. Garrison,"I just act that way to get chicks, dumb ass."
Stan,"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!"
Kyle,"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled."
Cartman,"Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana."
Stan,"Dude, what the hell is going in?!"
Kyle,Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
Stan,"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back."
Cartman,Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
Stan,"Thanks a lot, Frida!"
Stan,"Man, this condom's driving me crazy."
Cartman,"That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!"
Kyle,"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement."
Cartman,"Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!"
Cartman,Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?
Kyle,Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
Cartman,"Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round."
Cartman,"Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week."
Cartman,"Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!"
Cartman,"Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!"
Kyle,"It's okay, it's still the show."
Randy,"Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?"
Stan,"No, a double cheeseburger and fries!"
Kyle,"You guys, we have to hurry!"
Cartman,"Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?"
Cartman,"Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life."
Butters,"Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along."
Cartman,"All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?"
Cartman,"AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?"
Stan,"No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!"
Stan,Bluuch! I'd love to.
Kyle,He's fat and he's stupid?
Kyle,What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Cartman,"Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!"
Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
Stan,It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
Cartman,Just tell us already!
Kyle,That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
Kyle,So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
Stan,"Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!"
Kyle,"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby."
Cartman,How about a robot? How much for the robot?
Cartman,"You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo."
Stan,involves needing scissors and glue!
Randy,"Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it."
Kyle,"Aw, just forget it!"
Stan,"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?"
Butters,I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
Stan,"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go."
Stan,"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot."
Cartman,"Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism."
Randy,Walk to first! Woo!
Kyle,"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya."
Cartman,"Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness."
Butters,"Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?"
Stan,"It's all right, dad."
Cartman,"Um, could I get you to do something for me?"
Cartman,"You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down."
Cartman,"Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!"
Kyle,There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman?
Cartman,"I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!"
Stan,"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest."
Mr. Garrison,"Well, what did you think?"
Stan,"Hello? Hello, anybody here?"
Kyle,"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?"
Stan,"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before."
Kyle,"(Yes. Yes, hurry up.)"
Stan,Kicked out? Oh no!
Cartman,"Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke."
Stan,Have you reported this to any other authorities?
Cartman,"Give it back, Kyle!"
Cartman,"Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha!"
Kyle,"See?! That sucks, dude!"
Cartman,The black and brown people.
Stan,"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought."
Stan,So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
Cartman,"We take to the African sea!
We'll brave the squalls and bust your balls
Somalian pirates we!"
Kyle,"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there."
Stan,"Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it."
Kyle,"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia."
Stan,"Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of."
Butters,"Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?"
Cartman,What the hell are you talking about?
Stan,"Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny!"
Randy,Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE
Cartman,"Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you."
Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
Cartman,"Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?"
Kyle,"Dude, we're totally fucked now!"
Butters,"Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!"
Cartman,"Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice."
Butters,Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now.
Cartman,"Token.  Dude, dude. Dude."
Stan,"Dude, the two male judges love her."
Stan,"Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!"
Cartman,"Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh."
Randy,"I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?"
Cartman,"Por favor, buy our CDs de musica."
Kyle,"""Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind!"
Kyle,"Dude, we have to get to the mall!!"
Kyle,"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it."
Butters,"Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?"
Cartman,"Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now."
Cartman,"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!"
Stan,"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!"
Stan,"No, no, no, no, we want our money back."
Cartman,"No way, dude! What would I wipe with?"
Stan,Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Stan,"Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it."
Randy,You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
Kyle,"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings."
Butters,Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
Randy,"Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on."
Butters,This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
Kyle,"He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?"
Butters,"Teacher, my partner is back on the bus!"
Cartman,"Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!"
Cartman,"They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand!"
Kyle,Why does it matter?!
Stan,"Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit."
Stan,"Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason."
Cartman,"Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around."
Butters,"AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop!"
Cartman,Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
Cartman,"What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!"
Cartman,"Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle."
Kyle,Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
Butters,"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally."
Randy,The hologram's in our bedroom?
Mr. Garrison,"Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!"
Kyle,"Butters! Butters, is everything okay?"
Butters,That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
Cartman,You guys are just hella jealous.
Cartman,That dog is a gay homosexual.
Kyle,Where the hell is he?
Stan,"Dude, he's still not dead."
Kyle,I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus.
Butters,"Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm."
Randy,"Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!"
Kyle,"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene."
Mr. Garrison,Then you're an Indian.
Cartman,"Oh, it's on, bitch!"
Stan,"Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal."
Mr. Garrison,"Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful."
Kyle,"Dude, why do you care?!"
Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Kyle,Stop talking with your stupid hand!
Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!"
Randy,"I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse."
Butters,"Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-"
Kyle,Is here. To see me.
Stan,"Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please."
Mr. Garrison,"Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence?  Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy?"
Kyle,It doesn't prove anything!
Kyle,"There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny!"
Randy,Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
Stan,See? That's what happened to me!
Stan,"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse."
Cartman,"Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle?"
Butters,"But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig!"
Stan,"No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing."
Butters,"Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day!"
Randy,"Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?"
Cartman,"And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts."
Stan,"Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks."
Stan,"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us!"
Kyle,...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
Stan,Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
Stan,"And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this."
Cartman,"When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?"
Cartman,"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre."
Kyle,Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
Randy,"Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!"
Cartman,"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!"
Butters,But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
Randy,"You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place."
Stan,We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
Kyle,I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
Cartman,"We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down."
Randy,"Uh well, like anybody else thought it was ""naggers"". I mean, right?"
Stan,"Kyle. Kyle, wake up."
Kyle,"Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying."
Kyle,Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
Cartman,"Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls!"
Cartman,I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
Cartman,"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!"
Stan,"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen."
Cartman,"D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!"
Cartman,"Kyle, suck my balls."
Cartman,"Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!"
Kyle,Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Kyle,"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!"
Stan,"Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems."
Stan,"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi."
Mr. Garrison,"We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop."
Cartman,Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
Stan,"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!"
Stan,They've all been lying to us this whole time!
Cartman,"It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool."
Stan,"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!"
Cartman,"Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!"
Mr. Garrison,"I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad!  Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face..."
Stan,"Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders."
Butters,"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!"
Randy,"Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!"
Cartman,Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
Kyle,"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?"
Cartman,"Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!"
Cartman,"What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated."
Cartman,"This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year."
Cartman,"No, man, that's just a TV show."
Kyle,"Shh. Shut up, Kenny."
Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now."
Cartman,"You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!"
Kyle,"Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?"
Kyle,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Kyle,We just wanna go home.
Cartman,"I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE."
Cartman,"That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!"
Kyle,"He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine."
Randy,That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
Cartman,"These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard."
Butters,Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
Kyle,"Uh, could you use it in a sentence?"
Stan,"Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS."
Kyle,"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd."
Kyle,"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?"
Randy,"Dad, what are you doing??"
Cartman,"Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car."
Cartman,"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?!"
Kyle,"No, the nipples are more in the middle, see?"
Butters,"Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!"
Stan,"Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?"
Kyle,Four weeks we gotta do this?
Butters,"Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?"
Stan,What do you think happens if you do have it?
Kyle,"Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!"
Kyle,"Just tell us, Butters."
Cartman,Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits!
Butters,Well that sounds good.
Randy,"Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything."
Cartman,Over the meadow and through the woods...
Cartman,"Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now."
Cartman,So that's what this has all been about?
Stan,E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Mr. Garrison,"Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?"
Stan,"Screw this, I gotta get back to work!"
Cartman,"Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you."
Stan,"Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind."
Cartman,Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
Randy,"Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the ""no"" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!"
Stan,"Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?"
Cartman,God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
Stan,"Aww, do I have to?"
Stan,"""Vote or Die""?  What the hell does that even mean?!"
Cartman,"We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us."
Kyle,I'm thinking about it!
Cartman,"Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!"
Butters,"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!"
Cartman,"What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now."
Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, a dead body."
Kyle,"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan."
Cartman,"There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything."
Stan,"Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us."
Kyle,"Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?"
Stan,"There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!"
Stan,...well but... but that's my money.
Mr. Garrison,"Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?"
Butters,You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable.
Kyle,They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
Randy,"Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?"
Kyle,Do you see him?
Mr. Garrison,Mr. Hat isn't real.
Cartman,Or a really sweet one.
Randy,"Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going."
Butters,"Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!"
Stan,Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Cartman,"It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!"
Cartman,And panda bears for the preschoolers.
Kyle,"Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman."
Kyle,...What the hell are you talking about?!
Randy,"Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem."
Kyle,"Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea."
Cartman,You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
Stan,"Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does."
Randy,Isn't this great food?
Kyle,"There is no cure, you asshole!"
Cartman,I can shoot you too!
Stan,Ready. Let's see 'em.
Stan,"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school."
Kyle,"Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello?"
Cartman,"That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle?"
Butters,"Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night."
Stan,"Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same."
Cartman,"Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!"
Kyle,I still say this is a bad idea.
Kyle,They said that Chef works in one of these buildings
Randy,"We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay!"
Stan,"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?"
Stan,"Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??"
Cartman,"HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!"
Cartman,"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems."
Kyle,(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
Kyle,Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
Cartman,Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
Stan,"It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them."
Cartman,"Oh, your pussy village?"
Cartman,"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other."
Cartman,"Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!"
Butters,Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Cartman,"Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!"
Stan,"All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw."
Cartman,"Suck my balls, 20!"
Kyle,"Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad."
Mr. Garrison,"No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months."
Cartman,"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--"
Cartman,"Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy."
Kyle,"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV."
Cartman,Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
Kyle,"You won't get more votes than us, asshole!"
Stan,I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
Stan,Who are you people?
Stan,What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
Stan,And there's no score? No crowds?
Butters,How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
Butters,No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim!
Kyle,Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
Cartman,"Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles."
Kyle,There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Kyle,Well what the hell do we do?
Stan,"Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys."
Kyle,"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?"
Stan,Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
Kyle,Butters wrote a second book!
Cartman,"Well, I just, I kind of like having you around."
Cartman,"That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times."
Kyle,"Butters, what's happened to you?"
Cartman,"She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that."
Stan,"This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band."
Stan,Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!
Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so."
Cartman,Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison!
Butters,"Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again."
Kyle,"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off!"
Cartman,"Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?"
Cartman,"Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!"
Kyle,And that makes sense to you?
Butters,When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Stan,"Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend."
Butters,"Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?"
Kyle,"Dude, it's a dude!"
Cartman,"We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like."
Cartman,"Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?"
Cartman,"Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction."
Mr. Garrison,That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
Randy,"Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!"
Butters,"I love you too, Dad."
Cartman,What else do I have to do?!
Kyle,"Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool."
Cartman,"Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split"
Stan,"Dude, what is this place?"
Cartman,"Gah, French people piss me off."
Kyle,That's it? That's all they did?
Cartman,"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope."
Butters,Me! I saw a ghost!
Randy,Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
Stan,"Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw."
Kyle,"Damn, what a freak!"
Stan,"I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over."
Kyle,"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore."
Mr. Garrison,"Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today."
Kyle,"""Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha!"
Cartman,"Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!"
Kyle,But what if we're wrong?
Mr. Garrison,I'll just... be going up to bed now.  Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
Cartman,"Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you."
Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Kyle,"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about."
Randy,"That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting!"
Cartman,"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog."
Kyle,Dude… Chef is gone.
Cartman,"Yes, I have it right hmya."
Kyle,"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry."
Cartman,"Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey!"
Kyle,"Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!"
Stan,"Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore."
Cartman,No way dude. No way.
Stan,Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
Stan,"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!"
Kyle,"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low."
Stan,"That's not me, that's you!"
Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!"
Kyle,"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?"
Mr. Garrison,"I don't know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people."
Randy,"Aww crap!  Here, hold this!"
Butters,"Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?"""
Kyle,All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
Stan,"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!"
Cartman,Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
Cartman,"You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!"
Butters,"Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey."
Kyle,"Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix."
Stan,"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?"
Kyle,"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man."
Stan,"Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy."
Cartman,"Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name!"
Kyle,"You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30."
Randy,"Not much, sup with you guys?"
Stan,What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
Cartman,"Mom, have you been here all day?!"
Randy,"I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?"
Cartman,"Hoh boy, here we go."
Kyle,Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
Stan,Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out!
Cartman,"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!"
Kyle,"Shut the hell up, Cartman!"
Kyle,"Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-"
Stan,"Alright, now it's time for phase 2."
Kyle,"Dude, they've been doing that for a long time."
Randy,"Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry."
Kyle,"You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now."
Butters,They'll find love somewhere else.
Kyle,What are you doing here?
Cartman,"This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers."
Butters,"Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya."
Stan,"Okay okay, take the form of something else!"
Cartman,Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
Kyle,I need your help!
Stan,"Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!"
Stan,"Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?"
Cartman,Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
Butters,"Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'."
Stan,"You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!"
Cartman,"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle."
Cartman,"Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most."
Randy,"All right, what the hell is going on here?!"
Butters,"Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee."
Kyle,"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school."
Kyle,But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
Cartman,"Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters."
Stan,"Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!"
Mr. Garrison,"I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!"
Kyle,"Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!"
Randy,"Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  ""Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn""  ""Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."""
Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous."
Stan,Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
Randy,Get over there! Stay low!
Stan,"Well, we tried, dude."
Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?"
Randy,Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
Cartman,"You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?"
Kyle,"Hey, look you guys."
Cartman,"Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew."
Cartman,"Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!"
Stan,"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy."
Cartman,"Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!"
Cartman,"This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!"
Cartman,Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
Randy,Where did you get that kind of money??
Kyle,"No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets."
Cartman,"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you."
Stan,"Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it."
Kyle,"No dude, Butters' pee is in there."
Kyle,"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat."
Kyle,"Dude, it's a good show."
Cartman,"I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh!"
Mr. Garrison,...Well not like that!
Cartman,Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
Stan,"Okay, turn on the ignition,"
Cartman,"He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors."
Cartman,"Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started."
Kyle,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!"
Cartman,"Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-"
Stan,"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?"
Cartman,"Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!"
Stan,"Hey, you guys came back!"
Stan,"How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere."
Kyle,I made you out of clay.
Cartman,"You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!"
Kyle,Did the tooth fairy come?
Cartman,"Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!"
Stan,Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
Cartman,"Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!"
Stan,"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight."
Kyle,"No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!"
Randy,Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
Butters,"Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!"
Stan,"What's a ""tooth trade?"""
Cartman,"Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!"
Stan,"Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?"
Stan,"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that."
Cartman,Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
Stan,Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
Cartman,Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
Kyle,"Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat."
Stan,We did it! We did it!
Randy,OH!  Shelly! Hold on!
Kyle,If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
Randy,"You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people."
Kyle,We don't know who else to talk to.
Randy,Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth.
Stan,"Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back."
Cartman,"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?"
Stan,"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?"
Stan,"We, we got it."
Kyle,"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!"
Stan,"Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!"
Kyle,Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
Cartman,You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
Butters,"But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-"
Cartman,"Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch."
Kyle,"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice."
Cartman,"Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me."
Cartman,"Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?"
Cartman,Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God!
Stan,"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side."
Kyle,"Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it."
Stan,"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?"
Kyle,I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
Kyle,We totally think you should have more money.
Stan,"Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!"
Cartman,"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything."
Kyle,"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy."
Cartman,"Mom, please can we just leave?"
Butters,"Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?"
Cartman,"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities."
Butters,"Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?"
Kyle,"Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright."
Stan,"This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!"
Cartman,Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
Cartman,Yes. Who would take care of them?
Cartman,"No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!"
Butters,"It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart."
Cartman,"Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!"
Randy,"I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?"
Kyle,Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
Kyle,You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
Cartman,"Go kick his ass, Stan."
Randy,"Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning."
Randy,"Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare."
Cartman,God these guys are such dorks!
Kyle,It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
Cartman,"Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!"
Cartman,"Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through."
Cartman,We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
Cartman,Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
Stan,"Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you."
Kyle,Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
Randy,Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
Kyle,Really?! What's there not to understand?!
Stan,"That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back."
Randy,My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
Cartman,"Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars."
Cartman,"Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again."
Kyle,"Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?"
Kyle,"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls."
Kyle,"Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!"
Randy,"...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?"
Stan,Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Cartman,"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too."
Kyle,What the hell is that?  Oh my God.
Stan,"All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!"
Randy,"Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!"
Randy,"Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!"
Randy,Yeah thanks.  Asshole.
Cartman,"No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE!"
Randy,"It's obvious to me, girl"
Stan,"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes."
Cartman,"Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!"
Cartman,"Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!"
Cartman,"You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?"
Cartman,"One thousand dollars, yeah!"
Mr. Garrison,"Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper."
Stan,Well I don't drink coffee.
Butters,"Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!"
Kyle,I'm here to bust out Steve.
Stan,Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
Stan,"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something."
Stan,"This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point."
Stan,You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
Cartman,"Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for..."
Kyle,That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
Kyle,What is this? What's going on?
Kyle,Did they say if it's waterproof?
Stan,"Yeah! Well, not this time!"
Butters,"Oh. Well, uh okay."
Stan,"Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work."
Randy,When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
Cartman,"Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?"
Butters,"Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles."
Randy,"No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay."
Kyle,"Dude, it's coming through the window!"
Cartman,"Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win."
Kyle,I made you out of clay.
Cartman,"Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!"
Stan,"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes."
Kyle,"Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally."
Cartman,What? People see the truth?
Kyle,But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
Butters,You just got me busted forever!
Kyle,"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go."
Kyle,What do you want?!
Butters,"Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?"
Stan,"Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!"
Stan,This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
Cartman,"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!"
Cartman,Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
Mr. Garrison,Mother won't hear the truth!
Cartman,You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to!
Butters,"Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?"
Kyle,They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
Butters,"I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food."
Cartman,"Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face."
Stan,"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!"
Butters,"I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!"
Kyle,"The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids."
Randy,"Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you."
Cartman,"All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are."
Cartman,"What the hell is ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"""
Stan,"Hey, look, Craig just walked in."
Randy,"Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond."
Kyle,I don't get it either.
Stan,"I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!"
Cartman,Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese.
Randy,"You didn't realize! What are ""Canadian coins""?"
Kyle,"I am not, not, d-rinking pee!"
Cartman,"Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!"
Cartman,What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger!
Cartman,"Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?"
Cartman,"Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die!"
Stan,"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl."
Cartman,"How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?"
Cartman,"Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000."
Kyle,Ike. Ike!  It's over.
Stan,"Ahh, no thanks, that's okay."
Stan,I don't know. Let's go see.
Cartman,"Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh."
Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I get you."
Mr. Garrison,What the...?  Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.  Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself!
Butters,Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her!
Cartman,"Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!"
Randy,"Please I, I don't want any trouble."
Kyle,I told you guys he'd be here!
Cartman,"Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!"
Stan,"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there."
Stan,"Yeah, I remember hearing about that."
Stan,"This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe."
Cartman,"Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan."
Mr. Garrison,Do you have a feather on your head?
Cartman,"Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now."
Stan,We made a promise... to Jesus!
Cartman,"That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday."
Cartman,Jews can't be firemen.
Kyle,They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
Cartman,"This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!"
Stan,What do I have to do?
Butters,Okay.  Ow. Ooww!
Stan,"Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this."
Cartman,"Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in."
Stan,That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
Kyle,"Stan! Dude, is that you?"
Stan,"Thanks for the ride, Manuel."
Stan,"Dude, I think it's Saturday now."
Kyle,Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
Stan,The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
Cartman,"Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?"
Cartman,Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
Kyle,"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera."
Cartman,"Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!"
Randy,"Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno."
Kyle,"No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him."
Randy,Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
Kyle,"You figured that out, huh?"
Kyle,Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
Kyle,How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
Butters,There's vampires in the school!
Cartman,I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
Cartman,"Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits."
Kyle,You can't leave! The show starts soon!
Randy,"Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once."
Stan,"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded."
Kyle,On Wednesday or Thursday?
Cartman,"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level."
Randy,"There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us."
Randy,Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!
Cartman,"God damn it, lazy-ass whore."
Stan,"Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters."
Butters,"Hey, I was about to win!"
Kyle,"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you."
Cartman,I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care.
Randy,"You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!"
Stan,"But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun."
Randy,Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah.
Cartman,"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey."
Cartman,"Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?"
Cartman,Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
Cartman,"Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show."
Cartman,"No, no, he's done for. Come on!"
Kyle,I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can.
Cartman,"It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!"
Cartman,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you."
Kyle,"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!"
Cartman,"No, Mother! No more lies!"
Randy,I think he's pretty scared alright.
Randy,Aaah I don't know. Why?
Cartman,Put them in my laptop!
Cartman,"Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!"
Stan,"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?"
Kyle,"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot."
Randy,"We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger."
Cartman,"Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now."
Kyle,Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
Cartman,"No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!"
Stan,I'm me from the past?
Stan,That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
Kyle,"Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu."
Cartman,Look like ice cream to me.
Stan,"Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now."
Cartman,"Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler."
Butters,"Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!"
Butters,"The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow!"
Cartman,"Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?"
Butters,"Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!"
Stan,"Who?  Oh, shit."
Kyle,"Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?"
Kyle,You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
Cartman,See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
Kyle,"Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it."
Randy,"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?"
Butters,"Oh, well, here he is."
Cartman,"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!"
Randy,"You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?"
Stan,Nobody has any ideas?
Kyle,"Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!"
Butters,"Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls."
Cartman,"What the hell is a ""bris""?"
Stan,"Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!"
Cartman,This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend.
Randy,You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
Mr. Garrison,"Is there a problem, boys?"
Kyle,"We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card."
Cartman,"My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure."
Randy,"Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now."
Mr. Garrison,"Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?"
Cartman,What's the new topic?
Randy,"Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left."
Butters,"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?"
Kyle,"How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?"
Randy,Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!
Kyle,'Cause we hate him.
Stan,"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home."
Kyle,Oh who pees in the shower?
Stan,"Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!"
Randy,Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
Cartman,It's sooo amazing!  You spin this thing on the ground and it goes 'round and 'round. I could watch it aaall day!
Cartman,You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
Butters,"Oh, all right then."
Kyle,Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
Cartman,...I've got time. Do youuu??
Butters,I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way.
Cartman,Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
Cartman,Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
Mr. Garrison,"You're drunk, Mr. Hat!"
Cartman,"I know, it sucks."
Kyle,DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
Stan,"Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with."
Butters,"Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom."
Butters,I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.
Kyle,Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
Stan,I bet I scored 100!
Stan,The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
Butters,"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you."
Mr. Garrison,"All right, that does it!!"
Stan,"Dude, you're not gonna believe this."
Cartman,"Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!"
Kyle,We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
Stan,"Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags."
Butters,"Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy."
Stan,There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Kyle,"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool."
Kyle,"We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!"
Cartman,Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
Cartman,"Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?"
Cartman,"Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!"
Randy,"Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody."
Stan,"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?"
Butters,"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss."
Mr. Garrison,"Oh brother.  Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?  And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there."
Mr. Garrison,"Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia."
Butters,"Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!"
Cartman,"Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!"
Cartman,Don't talk about my mom like that!
Stan,"Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up."
Kyle,I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
Kyle,Watch out for ground eels!
Cartman,"I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle."
Kyle,How hard can it be? Look at it.
Cartman,"Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present."
Kyle,That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
Butters,"Yeah, I finished it!"
Randy,"You do not say ""Big silly goose""! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!"
Kyle,Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy.
Randy,"Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage."
Kyle,There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
Butters,I didn't say anything. I promise.
Stan,"That trick sucks, Jesus."
Mr. Garrison,"Well, uh d-don't you all look nice."
Cartman,"No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries."
Butters,"Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy."
Kyle,I don't have a problem.
Stan,Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
Randy,"Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!"
Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch."
Cartman,"Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap."
Stan,"Well, I can hardly wait."
Randy,"Oh hey, sorry boys."
Stan,What do we do with it?
Stan,"I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude."
Stan,What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
Butters,"Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah."
Cartman,One testicle!  What an asshole!
Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one."
Cartman,"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there."
Stan,We can start having fun again!
Kyle,"I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew..."
Cartman,Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye!
Cartman,"Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!"
Cartman,"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them."
Kyle,You're not an awesome teacher!
Mr. Garrison,"So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.  And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for.  You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?"
Stan,"Two four nine all right, this is the place."
Randy,Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo!
Butters,"Yes! Yes, anything else?"
Butters,I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
Kyle,I wanna be the tough one.
Butters,Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
Stan,You're gonna fight Satan?
Kyle,Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
Cartman,"Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy."
Kyle,How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
Cartman,Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
Kyle,"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision."
Stan,Where is he now?
Mr. Garrison,"You talkin' to me?  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either."
Stan,"No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body."
Randy,"It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?"
Kyle,I-It's good that it became something else.
Cartman,That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Butters,You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?"
Kyle,Hey look!  It's working.
Cartman,"Oh, that's so lame of them."
Cartman,"No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!"
Cartman,"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor."
Kyle,"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame."
Kyle,"Yeah, he just seems so young."
Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?"
Randy,Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
Stan,What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
Kyle,"Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?"
Cartman,"Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch."
Kyle,"We're here for Towelie, fatass!"
Kyle,"Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt."
Stan,"Yeah, I think that's great too."
Mr. Garrison,"Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?"
Stan,The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.
Cartman,"Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.  I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!  I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!  Poor piece of crap."
Kyle,Mom?! Where is Ike?!
Stan,We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
Kyle,Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
Kyle,"Dude, this is unbearable."
Kyle,"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!"
Butters,"Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?"
Stan,No! I broke the fucking dam!
Stan,Why is that funny?
Kyle,Where... is... the Internet?
Cartman,I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Cartman,"Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked!"
Kyle,"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?!"
Mr. Garrison,"Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-"
Randy,How do you know?!
Cartman,What? This is cool.
Cartman,We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
Stan,"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?"
Kyle,"It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now."
Cartman,"This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me."
Kyle,"Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?"
Butters,"He's a peckerface, that's what he is!"
Cartman,I think Towelie is awesome.
Cartman,"Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several."
Mr. Garrison,The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
Cartman,"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle."
Stan,"We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!"
Kyle,He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
Stan,"Some, kids from Orange County."
Kyle,I know what you mean.
Stan,"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick."
Kyle,"No, I just can't get it to load."
Kyle,"Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing."
Randy,Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
Cartman,"Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny!"
Randy,"I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!"
Cartman,"Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature."
Cartman,"I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo."
Cartman,"No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it."
Cartman,"Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot."
Stan,"Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!"
Cartman,"Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey."
Kyle,I have no idea.
Stan,"Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense."
Kyle,Dude. Being mature is boring!
Cartman,Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth!
Kyle,"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?"
Stan,"It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?"
Cartman,"Minata! Kite kite, churi..."
Kyle,We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Butters,Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
Stan,"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?"
Randy,The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go!
Cartman,"And I am the official messenger boy, I am."
Randy,"Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!"
Cartman,No! I hate hippies!
Cartman,"Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy."
Stan,Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
Mr. Garrison,You gotta get out!
Kyle,"No, turdpants, it's Kyle!"
Kyle,"Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will."
Kyle,But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
Cartman,"Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars."
Stan,"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger."
Cartman,"Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now."
Cartman,"Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?"
Butters,"Please, sir. I have to get home to my world."
Kyle,"He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex."
Cartman,"What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!"
Randy,"Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts."
Kyle,You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
Butters,"Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. ."
Cartman,"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!"
Kyle,"I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!"
Cartman,"Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?"
Kyle,"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now."
Butters,"I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here."
Kyle,"Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-"
Randy,I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down!
Cartman,The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
Cartman,"Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?"
Stan,"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?"
Kyle,"Hey guys, can we talk to you?"
Butters,"Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!"
Stan,"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?"
Cartman,Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
Kyle,"You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!"
Mr. Garrison,"All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner!"
Randy,Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets!
Stan,"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry."
Cartman,"Man, Indians have it good, huh?"
Kyle,Didn't you forget something?
Cartman,"It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!"
Mr. Garrison,"Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read."
Cartman,"Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys."
Cartman,I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
Stan,"And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this."
Kyle,This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake!
Kyle,That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
Kyle,"Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya."
Kyle,Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
Cartman,"Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!"
Cartman,You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
Butters,You sure you want to do this?
Butters,"Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!"
Stan,It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list.
Randy,"...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan."
Stan,It might hold the key to a curse.
Kyle,Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
Kyle,"Wow, that'd be cool."
Kyle,...Not anymore you're not.
Cartman,How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
Cartman,"Yeah, you guys are real hard core."
Kyle,"Jimmy, are you sure?"
Kyle,I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
Kyle,"Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient."
Kyle,"Oh, man, I don't feel so good."
Kyle,"All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America."
Mr. Garrison,What?? That's what I'm doing!
Kyle,"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!"
Randy,I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
Stan,"Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order."
Randy,"The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long."
Butters,"Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan."
Cartman,"...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?"
Cartman,"No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!"
Kyle,Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
Mr. Garrison,I can live with that.
Randy,"""Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers."" Alright.  ""Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are...""  ""slow-growing and can take years to develop."" Dammit.  ""Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive."" Oh this is good. ""There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation"" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?"
Cartman,"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you!"
Stan,"Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!"
Randy,"Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son."
Kyle,"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!"
Stan,"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results."
Mr. Garrison,It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
Cartman,"I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission."
Cartman,"You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that."
Stan,I'm not shooting anybody.
Kyle,Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
Cartman,"Oh, I'm sure I do."
Kyle,Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
Stan,"You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans!"
Cartman,"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?"
Randy,"Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?"
Cartman,"I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth."
Butters,"For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at..."
Stan,Where'd you get those?
Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?"
Stan,What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
Randy,And then she does. It's a metaphor.
Mr. Garrison,"Oh, please God, let it be forever."
Randy,"On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences."
Cartman,"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life."
Stan,"Please, take us to them! Please!"
Kyle,"Hey dude, how'd it-?"
Cartman,Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
Kyle,Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
Cartman,"Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up!"
Stan,She looks pretty hot here.
Cartman,Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
Stan,"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!"
Stan,So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
Butters,Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
Kyle,That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
Cartman,"He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people."
Butters,"Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die."
Cartman,"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"""
Cartman,No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
Stan,"You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too."
Stan,"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!"
Kyle,"You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?"
Stan,"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?"
Kyle,"Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??"
Mr. Garrison,Good. See you in school.
Kyle,"It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-"
Cartman,You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
Kyle,Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
Cartman,"Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me."
Cartman,I'm not saying it.
Kyle,This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
Cartman,"Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you."
Randy,"Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?"
Cartman,No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
Butters,"Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell?"
Kyle,How... do you make semen come out?
Cartman,And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
Mr. Garrison,"I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, ""The ball is red..."""
Cartman,For everything bad I've ever done?
Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!"
Butters,I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
Mr. Garrison,"Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!!"
Stan,"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!"
Stan,"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo."
Stan,"See, I told you dude."
Cartman,Hey! What's going on? What is that?
Cartman,Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
Stan,Just a second fat-ass!
Stan,Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!  I'm sick of it! It's completely immature."
Kyle,I'm going to break everything that you own!
Stan,"I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do."
Kyle,"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters."
Stan,"Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!"
Kyle,"Hey, look.  Hello?"
Cartman,"Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!"
Randy,"Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone."
Randy,"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know."
Cartman,Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
Butters,Ha-I'll be nine next week.
Randy,"Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!"
Mr. Garrison,"Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back."
Stan,Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Stan,"Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters."
Cartman,"No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback."
Kyle,"Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear."
Stan,"Kyle, what were you thinking?"
Kyle,Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
Cartman,"No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?"
Kyle,"Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!"
Kyle,"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up."
Cartman,"Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it."
Cartman,Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.  You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
Mr. Garrison,"You had me at ""free blanket."""
Cartman,"Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!"""
Kyle,"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29!"
Cartman,"Because, Butters, I'm... dead."
Randy,"Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There."
Randy,"Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme."
Cartman,"You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!"
Cartman,"I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you."
Kyle,"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us."
Stan,"Wow, that was short."
Kyle,"These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!"
Stan,"Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us."
Stan,Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
Cartman,"Heh, I hate those things."
Mr. Garrison,"Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon?"
Stan,But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
Stan,"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!"
Butters,"Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you."
Cartman,"Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!"
Cartman,"Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5."
Stan,"All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice."
Kyle,"Come on, let's go!"
Cartman,I guess we gotta go back to school.
Randy,No! That was a copy of me!
Cartman,He was a basketball player.
Stan,"""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"""
Stan,They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
Cartman,"Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends."
Kyle,Just come on! It's getting dark.
Butters,"Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir."
Butters,"Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD."
Butters,"Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad."
Stan,"Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!"
Cartman,"Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?"
Cartman,"Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive."
Stan,What the hell is going on here?
Kyle,Can you see anything?
Stan,"Dude, that kicks ass!"
Randy,Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
Stan,"What's ""lose bowel control?"""
Cartman,"I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it."
Stan,What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
Cartman,They are gonna cut off his fireman!
Cartman,"Testing, testing, 1 2.  Sweet."
Cartman,"You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!"
Butters,So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
Cartman,"Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here!"
Stan,"We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it."
Cartman,"Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?"
Stan,My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ.
Kyle,Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
Kyle,"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?"
Randy,"Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!"
Cartman,"It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil."
Stan,"Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here."
Stan,D'you think that's enough?
Cartman,"Oh my God, this is sooo cute."
Kyle,"Hogh, my stomach hurts."
Cartman,"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?!"
Butters,"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?"
Kyle,"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?"
Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mis-Mr. Twig?  Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!"
Butters,Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
Kyle,Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Stan,"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"""
Stan,"All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?"
Cartman,"Oh, dude, here it comes!"
Mr. Garrison,"You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!"
Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say ""get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"""
Stan,"Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home."
Cartman,"Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!"
Cartman,"Dude. Come on, now. Come on."
Kyle,"You're right.  Jesus, that was fun..."
Randy,"Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine."
Cartman,JESUS IS A LIE!
Stan,"...He's got us there, dude."
Stan,Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
Kyle,I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
Cartman,"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies."
Cartman,"I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen."
Kyle,It doesn't even look like they're open.
Stan,I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
Cartman,"Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand."
Kyle,Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
Cartman,"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this."
Randy,Just trying to leave without being rude.
Randy,"Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show."
Cartman,Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
Mr. Garrison,"SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you!"
Kyle,I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
Stan,"Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing."
Stan,Then you're a stupid douche
Cartman,"There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park)."
Cartman,"You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!"
Stan,"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher."
Cartman,Where is it? Where is it?!
Cartman,"Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about."
Cartman,I think my mom is a corporation.
Stan,Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
Cartman,"Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool."
Stan,Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever.
Cartman,"Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool."
Butters,What are you whoofelin' at?
Stan,"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films."
Mr. Garrison,"Wow, that's... really great to hear."
Stan,"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!"
Butters,"Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat."
Kyle,"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come."
Cartman,"I get to wear it first, you guys."
Randy,You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
Cartman,"Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!"
Kyle,Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Cartman,Do you think I'm an idiot?
Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!"
Cartman,That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
Kyle,"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go."
Cartman,"You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!"
Randy,"Alright, alright, that's enough, boys."
Cartman,"Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?"
Butters,"Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary."
Kyle,Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
Cartman,"I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!"
Kyle,"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?"
Kyle,How long does this thing last?
Cartman,"I need to speak with him, please."
Randy,"Yeah, you know what? Fuck you!"
Cartman,"He's lying, dude. Hit X"
Kyle,"Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!"
Stan,Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
Cartman,Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!
Butters,"I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!"
Butters,But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
Kyle,"Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!"
Stan,"Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to."
Cartman,"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice."
Kyle,"You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you."
Kyle,I don't care if I signed an agreement!
Randy,"Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!"
Kyle,"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!"
Stan,"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards."
Mr. Garrison,"Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next."
Cartman,"Look, a covetous Jew!"
Butters,"Uh, I won't tell anybody."
Mr. Garrison,"Good.  Very good.  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons."
Cartman,I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
Butters,He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
Kyle,That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
Cartman,Oho yes! I did it I did it!
Butters,Oh God! Oh Jesus!
Stan,"Dude, it's our dads."
Butters,You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
Butters,No- but you don't sound like me.
Stan,"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on."
Butters,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!"
Stan,Now do you people believe me?
Randy,You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
Kyle,A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
Cartman,"Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!"
Stan,Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
Stan,"Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?"
Cartman,"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash."
Cartman,"Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken."
Cartman,"Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!"
Kyle,"Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?"
Kyle,It's not working here?
Mr. Garrison,"Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather."
Stan,I have a button we can use for his nose.
Stan,"Come on, guys, we're running out of time!"
Randy,What do you want?
Cartman,"No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on!"
Cartman,"All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards!"
Kyle,"'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!"
Kyle,Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
Randy,"And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about."
Randy,"Yes I do, yes I do."
Cartman,'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
Stan,"Muhammad, are you okay?"
Stan,We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
Mr. Garrison,"Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired."
Kyle,I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge.
Stan,Did you hear anything more about what happened?
Mr. Garrison,"Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!"
Kyle,Just just leave it alone.
Kyle,You don't have any powers!
Cartman,Holy crap!  Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
Kyle,How do you do that?
Cartman,"Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house."
Stan,Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
Stan,We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
Cartman,"Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?"
Mr. Garrison,"Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you?"
Kyle,A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
Kyle,"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"""
Butters,Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
Cartman,You sons of bitches!
Stan,"Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh!"
Cartman,"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?"
Kyle,"It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this."
Butters,"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide."
Kyle,All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
Butters,"Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!"
Kyle,I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them.
Randy,"Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now."
Mr. Garrison,"Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me!"
Cartman,Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha.
Cartman,"- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -"
Mr. Garrison,"Look, there's more of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main."
Kyle,"I'm a hundred percent ready, coach!"
Cartman,"Who you calling stupid, Jew?"
Cartman,I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me.
Cartman,I would like some Sunny Delight too.
Kyle,"No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it."
Cartman,"I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?"
Cartman,The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
Mr. Garrison,I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have.  Are there problems at home?
Cartman,"Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude."
Cartman,Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER!
Kyle,"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!"
Butters,"I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?"
Cartman,"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified."
Kyle,What's wrong with his face?
Butters,"Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more."
Stan,"I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay."
Cartman,"Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!"
Cartman,"Yes, and no time to do it. No time..."
Cartman,Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
Kyle,"Alright, what is it?!"
Kyle,Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
Kyle,"Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly."
Kyle,"You mean, intercourse with a girl?"
Kyle,"Jesus, you may be right."
Stan,We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Mr. Garrison,There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
Randy,It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
Cartman,"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!"
Randy,Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
Cartman,"Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by."
Randy,JUST GET THE GUN!!
Kyle,Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
Randy,"The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO!"
Cartman,"We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa!"
Kyle,I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
Randy,"Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better."
Kyle,"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things."
Butters,I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
Randy,"Come on, Stan, let's get some rest."
Randy,"Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!"
Kyle,"What have you done, Cartman?!"
Cartman,"...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today!"
Kyle,"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart."
Cartman,We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
Stan,"Cartman, you have to stop!"
Kyle,WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
Randy,Will he be okay out of the hospital?
Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!"
Cartman,"YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!"
Mr. Garrison,This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car, please."
Cartman,Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
Randy,"You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!"
Stan,"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
Mr. Garrison,"Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?"
Kyle,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Cartman,Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
Cartman,"Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom!"
Kyle,"Come on, we've gotta go!"
Stan,Why does it matter?!
Cartman,"There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!"
Cartman,"It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it."
Cartman,"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?"
Cartman,Then start explaining it to me!
Stan,How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
Kyle,"Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up."
Randy,"Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!"
Cartman,Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
Stan,"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter."
Stan,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?"
Cartman,"All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'."
Randy,"Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad."
Kyle,Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back.
Cartman,"No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes."
Stan,Are we gonna go to hell?
Cartman,"Go play with yourself, Craig."
Stan,"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!"
Cartman,"And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight!"
Cartman,"No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him."
Randy,"Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?"
Stan,No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
Cartman,"Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?"
Kyle,"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here."
Stan,"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?"
Kyle,"Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it."
Cartman,No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
Cartman,Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
Cartman,We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...!
Kyle,"Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!"
Kyle,That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
Randy,"...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!"
Kyle,Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
Kyle,What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
Stan,"Dude, I told you something was up with this place!"
Stan,That is our understanding.
Stan,Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
Kyle,"Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!"
Stan,What are they talking about?
Kyle,Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
Kyle,"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire."
Cartman,"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-"
Kyle,What was your paper about Wendy?
Stan,"I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play."
Cartman,"It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!"
Butters,Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want.
Stan,I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Cartman,"I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?"
Kyle,This doesn't make any sense!
Mr. Garrison,"Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?"
Butters,"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me."
Stan,"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor."
Kyle,"What's this all about, Kenny?"
Cartman,He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
Mr. Garrison,They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
Stan,"Wait, it's not a real illness?"
Cartman,Well... well then he's NOT alive.
Cartman,Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
Randy,"Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close."
Kyle,We're gong to New York?
Stan,"Let go of my face, asshole!"
Stan,"Okay. Okay, I think we lost them."
Stan,"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?"
Kyle,"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now."
Stan,I took them to see how abortions are done.
Kyle,"Well...  Well, what do you want?"
Stan,"Oh, he's fine, dude."
Kyle,"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?"
Mr. Garrison,But this is insane!
Randy,"Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot"
Cartman,Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
Kyle,"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!"
Kyle,"That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."""
Butters,"Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!"
Mr. Garrison,"Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!"
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS!"
Stan,"I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?"
Cartman,All we need is teeth.
Cartman,"It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!"
Kyle,"Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children."
Stan,"Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?"
Stan,Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
Butters,I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
Randy,"Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments."
Kyle,"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight.."
Kyle,"You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke."
Stan,Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
Cartman,Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
Butters,Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God!
Kyle,It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
Butters,"Uh hello, I'm Butters."
Cartman,Where are we going?
Kyle,"Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains."
Butters,"Eric, are you sure you can do this?"
Kyle,"Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out."
