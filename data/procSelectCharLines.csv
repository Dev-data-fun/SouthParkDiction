But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"".

I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East 
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, 
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday 
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. 
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. 
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.

Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.

They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.

Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. 
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you.
